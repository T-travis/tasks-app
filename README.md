# Tasks App
This is a tasks application I designed to gain experience making a serverless RESTful API, as well as gaining experience 
using Node.js, AWS Lambda, API Gateway, and DynamoDB. It incorporates all CRUD (create, read, update, delete) functions 
using the HTTP methods POST, GET, PUT, and DELETE.
